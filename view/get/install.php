phpFramewerk - Installation

  Installation procedure:
    [1] In your web root extract the distribution 
	(be sure to untar the subdirectories)
        tar -xzvf phpFramewerk_x.x.x.tar.gz
    [2] Open the file config.php in conf folder
	with your text editor and change the 
	values of configuration to fit your environment.
    [3] Open the URL /framewerk0.0.2/index.php
        in your browser. phpFramewerk should now 
	display a welcome screen.
    [4] If desired, move the directories 
	conf,library and view out of the web 
	server root. This will prevent someone 
	from gaining direct access to them	
	via the web server and gives 
	somewhat greater security.
